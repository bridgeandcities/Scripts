Originally forked for the fan management script but I have added other scripts I've written myself here for the sake of keeping things tidy and in one place.
Update script thanks to https://github.com/Sean0x54.

I have been running the fan control script 24/7 since March 2019 on boot using cron.
Backup script running since September 2019 weekly using cron.
